## Heart Attack Indicators Analysis

**The workflow includes:**
- data loading, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and summary insights. A simple machine learning component was included as a bonus requirement.
- The project was completed collaboratively by **Amany Shabban** and **Doha Walid**.

  ## 📌 Project Overview
  - Load and inspect the dataset using Pandas.
  - Check data structure, missing values, and unique counts per feature.
  - Generate descriptive statistics and highlight minimum/maximum values.
  - Visualize key distributions including:
  - Heart disease prevalence.
  - Gender-based comparison.
  - BMI distribution.
  - Age category and physical activity trends.
  - Provide insights after each visualization. 
  - (Bonus) Apply an ML model to evaluate the data’s predictive potenti
 
  ## Summary
  - The analysis identifies major health indicators related to heart disease and visualizes how different demographic and lifestyle factors correlate with risk levels. 
  - The project demonstrates practical use of Python data analysis libraries, supported by optional machine learning for predictive exploration.
